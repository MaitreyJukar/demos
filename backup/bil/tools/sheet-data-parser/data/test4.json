The officer stood on the bank of the river and lowered the visor on his cap until the farthest thing visible was the edge of the bank on the other side. He then turned and noted the point on his side that was in line with the tip of his visor and his eye. The officer then paced the distance to this point and concluded that distance was the width of the river. a. Study the figure. Then explain how the officer concluded that the width of the river is EG."
