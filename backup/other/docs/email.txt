Don't let the spark die

Respected Sir/Madam,

	I have been suppressing the urge to send this e-mail since about 5 months now; but since I feel it is inevitable, I am trying to put forward all those unexpressed thoughts.
	
	I am writing this e-mail representing my colleagues and friends. It might be a little too late to say this, but we need to this for our satisfaction.
	
	To be very honest, most of us haven't been very happy or content since we got to know that we wouldn't be recieving any increment as the Company's policy changed. We were also quiet disappointed by the feedback that we got, and were awaitng a detailed feedback, which sadly, hasn't been recieved yet. We understand that there may be some limitations, but we shall still hope we recieve it soon.
	
	We were hoping that we'd be able to move past the disappointment caused by the decisions; but sadly, we have'nt yet been able to. The work environment which we once loved working in, is being populated by negativity. Every new day is a fresh start; but as the days pass by and we communicate and share the problems that we have been facing, somewhere inside us, the spark fades.

Since this is the beginning of our awaited bright future, we are all very enthusiastic and ambitious. We have worked equally sincerely and happily as our respected seniors have. Most have us have left our comfortable homes far away and come to this city of dreams with dreams in our eyes. We really do not want to feel failed at the very first step. We do not mean to say that money is what we work for; but practically speaking, it is a very important part of life. Also, everyone loves being appreciated, isn't it?
