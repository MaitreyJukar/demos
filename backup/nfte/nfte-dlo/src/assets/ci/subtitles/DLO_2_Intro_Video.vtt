Hi. My name is Angela Ivana and I’m the CEO 
and founder of CosmoSafe, a beauty 

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000 line:80%
edtech company. We offer more than content in a platform.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000 line:80%
We’re challenging an outdated education system

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000 line:80%
so we can help beauty professionals

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000 line:80%
and change the future of beauty education.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000 line:80%
I was a disenchanted high school student when I joined the NFTE program.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000 line:80%
I feared school would lead to a cycle of sitting at more desks all my life.

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000 line:80%
NFTE reignited my excitement for school.

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000 line:80%
They helped me connect the dots between education

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000 line:80%
and my future through entrepreneurship.

11
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000 line:80%
I supported myself in high school and college by working in financial services.

12
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000 line:80%
However, the market crashed, 
and my work experience in banking no longer mattered.

13
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000 line:80%
After graduating college, I felt law school was no longer an option

14
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000 line:80%
because of the amount of debt I had acquired.

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000 line:80%
When I couldn’t find work, I got creative 
and I started a mobile makeup business.

16
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000 line:80%
Later, I took a job as a regional education manager 
for a massive beauty brand.

17
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000 line:80%
This job led me to discovering education needs in the beauty industry.

18
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000 line:80%
Makeup professionals were telling me that their hair 
and cosmetology degrees

19
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000 line:80%
had failed to prepare them for the real world,

20
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000 line:80%
and that they couldn’t afford to pay back their loans.

21
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000 line:80%
Well, after graduating during a market crash, 
I understood what that was like:

22
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000 line:80% 
to have a worthless degree, poor job prospects, and high debt.

23
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000 line:80%
CosmoSafe demonstrates creativity and innovation

24
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000 line:80%
because we’re supplying the beauty market with a unique 
and unexpected approach to education

25
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000 line:80%
which solves problems for beauty professionals, states, 
and retail cosmetic businesses. 

26
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000 line:80%
Currently, beauty schools pair makeup artistry with skincare or haircare.

27
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000 line:80%
Makeup schools then assume that makeup artists only need to 
learn techniques like how to do a red lip.

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000 line:80%
CosmoSafe is here to challenge that.

29
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000 line:80%
Using beauty industry culture, we’re creatively applying

30
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000 line:80% 
the idea of online certification to the beauty industry.

31
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000 line:80%
We focus on previously ignored content like hygiene, science, 

32
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000 line:80%
and business principles for makeup artistry.

33
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000 line:80%
We’re excited to innovate and create a future 
where beauty education is offered online

34
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000 line:80%
in a fun, affordable, and engaging way.
