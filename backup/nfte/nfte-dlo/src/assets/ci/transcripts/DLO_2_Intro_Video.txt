Hi. My name is Angela Ivana and I’m the CEO and founder of CosmoSafe, a beauty edtech company. We offer more than content in a platform. 

We’re challenging an outdated education system so we can help beauty professionals and change the future of beauty education.

I was a disenchanted high school student when I joined the NFTE program. I feared school would lead to a cycle of sitting at more desks all my life. 

NFTE reignited my excitement for school. They helped me connect the dots between education and my future through entrepreneurship. I supported myself in high school and college by working in financial services.

However, the market crashed, and my work experience in banking no longer mattered. After graduating college, I felt law school was no longer an option because of the amount of debt I had acquired. 

When I couldn’t find work, I got creative and I started a mobile makeup business. Later, I took a job as a regional education manager for a massive beauty brand. 

This job led me to discovering education needs in the beauty industry. Makeup professionals were telling me that their hair and cosmetology degrees had failed to prepare them for the real world, and that they couldn’t afford to pay back their loans.

Well, after graduating during a market crash, I understood what that was like: to have a worthless degree, poor job prospects, and high debt.

CosmoSafe demonstrates creativity and innovation because we’re supplying the beauty market with a unique and unexpected approach to education which solves problems for beauty professionals, states, and retail cosmetic businesses.

Currently, beauty schools pair makeup artistry with skincare or haircare.

Makeup schools then assume that makeup artists only need to learn techniques like how to do a red lip. CosmoSafe is here to challenge that. 

Using beauty industry culture, we’re creatively applying the idea of online certification to the beauty industry. We focus on previously ignored content like hygiene, science, and business principles for makeup artistry.

We’re excited to innovate and create a future where beauty education is offered online in a fun, affordable, and engaging way.
