    "tab1Description": "Jaden is a pastry chef. He loves to experiment with creative and innovative desserts. In his early days as an entrepreneur, he often had clients who preferred traditional items, and his business nearly collapsed due to the negative reviews he received. However, Jaden was determined to create new items and make a success of it. He started advertising his creations as unique, one-of-a-kind desserts and slowly built up a customer base that truly appreciated his efforts.<br/> <br/>Go through the tabs to explore the qualities that make him a successful entrepreneur.",
    "tab2Heading": "Implement strategies to anticipate and reduce risk",
    "tab2Description": "The price of raw materials often varies and can affect the amount of profit a business makes. This is especially true for some of the exotic ingredients that Jaden imports. To minimize this risk, Jaden has an annual contract with his vendor for purchasing materials at a fixed rate.",
    "tab3Heading": "Weigh potential benefits and tradeoffs or costs",
    "tab3Description": "A fancy school in France offers a course in culinary arts that Jaden would love to attend. Jaden carefully considers the costs – travel, school fees, and living in France for the duration of the course. On the other hand, with an expanded skill set and a fancy degree in hand, he could continue pursuing his passion for making innovative desserts and target a more sophisticated customer base. Jaden calculates that it would take him less than a year to cover the costs. The benefits outweigh the costs. And off he goes!",
    "tab4Heading": "Develop a plan to achieve goals regardless of obstacles",
    "tab4Description": "Jaden has ambitions to become world-renowned in his field. His immediate goals are to either participate in an international pastry contest within a year or work for 3 months under a pastry chef who already has an international acclaim.",
    "tab5Heading": "Willingly change course in pursuit of new opportunities",
    "tab5Description": "After years of specializing in pastries, Jaden is now approached by a wealthy retired man with the offer of being a partner in a new restaurant. The man would finance the place and Jaden would run it. Jaden considers the offer carefully and is willing to risk changing course from being a specialist pastry chef to be a chef-owner!",
    "jeffTitle": "A man comfortable with risk",
    "jeffDEsc": "One example of an entrepreneur who has been comfortable with risk is Jeff Bezos.</br>Bezos had a comfortable well-paying job on Wall Street. When he realized that the web was growing at a phenomenal rate, he recognized an opportunity. He took a tremendous risk by quitting his job to launch an online book store, Amazon.com.</br> At the time, many experts thought an online book store would fail. However, over the years, not only did Amazon become one of the largest retail companies in the world, Bezos’s empire has also expanded to newspapers, a rocket company, a grocery giant, health care, and more.</br>This phenomenal success has been possible due to Bezos’s entrepreneurial mindset characterized by his comfort with risk.",

In fact, many of them gift her raw materials such as card paper, colors, and decorative material to encourage her talent.</br>She now wants to turn her hobby into a business, selling handmade and printed greeting cards. She has a small home computer. However, to design digital cards, she would need to invest in resources such as a better computer, a high-quality color printer and a greeting card or desktop publishing software. To attract local business, she would also like to rent an office downtown.</br>Amy is excellent at drawing and making her own illustrations.
