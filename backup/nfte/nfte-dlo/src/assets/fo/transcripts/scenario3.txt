In 1968, while trying to invent a super-strong adhesive, a chemist accidentally invented an adhesive that could be repositioned multiple times. 

It took five years and lots of brainstorming to identify the ways that this new invention could be used. The result was sticky notes. 

Brainstorming helps businesses and entrepreneurs find new ways to use existing products, services, and technologies.
