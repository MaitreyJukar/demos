What makes a goal SMART?
Specific: Spell out exactly what you want to achieve in your goal statement, such as saving money for the down payment of your shop.
Measurable: Your goal must be measurable; for example, save $400 every month.
Action-Oriented: List the actions required for reaching your goal, such as reducing expenditures by buying used office equipment or using freelancers or contractors instead of full-time employees. 
Realistic: Your goal must be achievable. For example, after accounting for your monthly expenses, do you have $400 to save? 
Time-Specific: Set a target date for completion, such as one year.

So your SMART goal is to “save money for the down payment of your shop by putting aside $400 every month for one year.”
