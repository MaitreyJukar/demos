What makes a goal SMART?

00:00:03.055 --> 00:00:11.196
Specific: Spell out exactly what you want to achieve in your goal statement,
such as saving money for the down payment of your shop.

00:00:12.672 --> 00:00:18.874
Measurable: Your goal must be measurable;
 for example, save $400 every month.

00:00:20.918 --> 00:00:33.784
Action-Oriented: List the actions required for reaching your goal, 
such as reducing expenditures by buying used office equipment or
using freelancers or contractors instead of full-time employees.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:45.954
Realistic: Your goal must be achievable. For example, 
after accounting for your monthly expenses, do you have $400 to save?

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:53.551
Time-Specific: Set a target date for completion, such as one year.

00:00:55.362 --> 00:01:03.570
So your SMART goal is to “save money for the down payment 
of your shop by putting aside $400 every month for one year.”
