Do you play video games? If so, you’re not

2
00:02.000 --> 00:04.000 line:80%
alone. In fact, there is someone who plays

3
00:04.000 --> 00:06.000 line:80%
video games regularly in nearly two-thirds

4
00:06.000 --> 00:09.000 line:80%
of American homes. Since gaming devices

5
00:09.000 --> 00:11.000 line:80%
became popular in the late 1980s, games

6
00:11.000 --> 00:14.000 line:80%
could be played on a handheld device or

7
00:14.000 --> 00:16.000 line:80%
a console-based system. Although some

8
00:16.000 --> 00:18.000 line:80%
games were produced for both formats,

9
00:18.000 --> 00:20.000 line:80%
there was no way to move between the two

10
00:20.000 --> 00:22.000 line:80%
types of systems while playing a single

11
00:22.000 --> 00:24.000 line:80%
game. This was the “usual” in the gaming

12
00:24.000 --> 00:27.000 line:80%
console market until someone challenged it.
