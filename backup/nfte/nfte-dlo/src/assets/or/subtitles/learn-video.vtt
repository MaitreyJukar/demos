Hi. I'm Mark Thompson, and I'm the founder
and creative director of MarkMedia,

2
00:03.666 --> 00:06.112 line:80%
a creative communications and marketing agency.

3
00:06.250 --> 00:08.306 line:80%
I did NFTE when I was in high school.

4
00:08.384 --> 00:10.912 line:80%
The problem I wanted to solve was my school’s yearbook.

5
00:11.208 --> 00:15.963 line:80%
Like any yearbook club, there’s about four to five
people that mostly put pictures of themselves and

6
00:16.056 --> 00:19.987 line:80%
their friends in the yearbook, and a lot of
people end up getting left out, including me.

7
00:20.523 --> 00:23.059 line:80%
Plus, the yearbook cost about 80 to 100 dollars,

8
00:23.118 --> 00:26.877 line:80%
and I didn't think it was fair that you might only
see yourself one or two times in the yearbook.

9
00:27.338 --> 00:30.700 line:80%
With NFTE, I made a business plan to create a new yearbook.

10
00:30.763 --> 00:33.472 line:80%
It would be a video which was really new at the time.

11
00:33.544 --> 00:34.920 line:80%
This was before social media.

12
00:35.378 --> 00:40.147 line:80%
I got student feedback on what they wanted in the
yearbook and what they would be willing to pay.

13
00:40.300 --> 00:45.840 line:80%
Then I went out and shot all the best school events,
from sports, class life, senior interviews,

14
00:45.987 --> 00:50.541 line:80%
put really cool music on it and special effects,
and sold it at a very competitive price.

15
00:50.571 --> 00:51.687 line:80%
It was very successful.

16
00:52.520 --> 00:54.976 line:80%
Then I went to the University of Michigan Business School.

17
00:55.100 --> 00:58.582 line:80%
At Michigan, I saw that most students
now had their own digital cameras

18
00:58.629 --> 01:04.147 line:80%
and it made me think that instead of just me creating the
yearbook, everyone could collaborate on this project

19
01:04.202 --> 01:07.923 line:80%
and we can all add in our photos and
videos using sharing technology.

20
01:08.241 --> 01:09.856 line:80%
I took this business plan,

21
01:09.930 --> 01:15.241 line:80%
which I called VidFlips to a number of business competitions
and I ended up winning entrepreneur of the year.

22
01:15.292 --> 01:19.524 line:80%
After I graduated from Michigan, I went into
finance and eventually venture capital.

23
01:19.583 --> 01:25.191 line:80%
When I was in venture capital, I evaluated startups and
entrepreneurs to see what our fund would invest in.

24
01:25.280 --> 01:29.713 line:80%
I noticed that a lot of startups, while they
had great business ideas and great teams,

25
01:29.806 --> 01:32.749 line:80%
they didn't often have the strongest
visual marketing materials.

26
01:33.232 --> 01:35.833 line:80%
I especially saw this for social impact companies,

27
01:35.894 --> 01:40.241 line:80%
who were doing amazing work in great
communities, but it wasn't being captured.

28
01:40.760 --> 01:46.345 line:80%
I launched MarkMedia because I saw that I could support
nonprofits, foundations, startups, and investors

29
01:46.402 --> 01:50.584 line:80%
to better capture their work, so that they
could keep focusing on growing their mission.

30
01:51.009 --> 01:55.146 line:80%
For me, opportunity recognition has always
been about my own interests and abilities,

31
01:55.219 --> 01:57.453 line:80%
and seeing what problems I could uniquely solve.

32
01:57.924 --> 02:02.954 line:80%
Because my talent is visual communication and
technology, I see opportunities in that area.

33
02:03.208 --> 02:05.790 line:80%
That's been the theme of my entrepreneurial journey.

34
02:05.946 --> 02:10.806 line:80%
For any young entrepreneur, I'd say to trust your viewpoint
and perspective because the problems that you see

35
02:11.010 --> 02:13.858 line:80%
– other people might not see them
because they don't have the same lens

36
02:14.038 --> 02:18.435 line:80%
– and that positions you to develop really interesting
solutions that no one else could think of.

37
02:18.486 --> 02:20.206 line:80%
And that's what makes an entrepreneur.
