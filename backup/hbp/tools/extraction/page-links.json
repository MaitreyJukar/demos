This test will allow you to assess your knowledge of some basic modeling skills.</p><p>To advance from one question to the next, select one of the answer choices and click the Submit button. After submitting your answer, you will not be able to change it or return to the question, so make sure you are satisfied with your selection before you submit each answer.</p><p>Some problems ask you for a formula. It is probably easiest to determine the correct formula in Excel and then paste it into the Pretest answer area. This will avoid syntax errors. For example, if in Excel you type in the formula =SUMIF(B1:B10,C8,D1:D10) and think that is the correct answer, just select SUMIF(B1:B10,C8,D1:D10) in Excel and copy it. Then paste it into the input answer area within the question. Do NOT include any unnecessary spaces in your answers.</p><p>Your results will be displayed immediately upon completion of the test. The results screen will display each question with a graphic notation indicating your score: X for incorrect and check mark for correct.</p><p>Click Pretest in the menu bar to the left to begin. You can also return to your test results at any time (after completing the exam) by clicking Pretest Introduction and then Pretest.</p><p>Good luck!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"a3 asset\">\n\t<img src=\"%PAGE_ROOT%/pretest_intro.png\">\n</div>\n"

If you have used Excel extensively you may choose to skip these chapters. In the Excel Formulas and Functions sections, we thoroughly explain how to enter and copy formulas in Excel. We also will teach you about Excel's many powerful functions including little known functions such as MATCH and INDEX. Just like the key to a great recipe is the proper use of that special spice or ingredient, the key to building a spreadsheet that solves a business problem is often mastery of Excel's many powerful functions. </p><p>In the section on Excel Functions, we cover Excel's many tools that can be used to create great looking and informative reports (conditional formatting, pivot tables, subtotals, SUMIFS and COUNTIFS functions, etc.). In the Charts section, we show you how to use Excel to create informative charts. In the next section, you will learn how to import word files and Internet data into the Excel environment. </p><p>The Art of Spreadsheet Modeling section contains an extensive explanation of how to build spreadsheet models to solve a business problem. For example, should a bakery open a new outlet? How should we plan to save for retirement?  In this section, we cover many exciting modeling tools such as Auditing, spinner controls, Goal Seek, Data Validation and Data Tables.  The Using Excel Solver section covers the Excel Solver tool which is used to find the optimal solution to a problem. The Three-Dimensional Formulas section explains how 3D formulas and Excel's Table feature can make you much more efficient when you develop spreadsheet models. Finally, the Monte Carlo Simulation closes the course by introducing you to a really efficient model building tool. In that section, you will learn how Monte Carlo simulation can be used to model the effect of uncertainty on business decisions. </p><p>The spreadsheet is the canvas for the business analyst.  This course gives you the \"artistic skills\" needed to develop state of the art spreadsheet models for solving business problems.</p>\n</div>\n"

Designing for usability by others is important. Among other considerations, you might want to minimize the amount of time it takes others to understand how you have organized a workbook, or limit the ways in which they can introduce errors into a workbook. You might want to control the kind of data that can be entered in cells, prevent users from deleting formulas, or even keep the workbook window from being resized.</p><p>In this chapter, we will look at a few simple things you can do to make your worksheets more user-friendly in terms of simple readability.

We can see from the first five examples that 1/1/1900 is the beginning of the Excel epoch, and that each date is 1 greater than the day before. As Excel understands it, Prince was born on 21343!</p><p>What this means is that values meant to be numeric in nature can be displayed as dates, and values meant to be dates can be displayed as numbers. Expecting to see a cell display, for example, the number 13 as the output of some operation, and instead seeing 1/13/1900, can cause a good deal of confusion to the beginning Excel user. By the same token, Excel will also be happy to format Prince's birthday, 6/7/1958, as Currency, displaying $21,343.00 as a result.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"a4 asset\">\n\t<p>There are many ways to display dates in Excel; on the right are some examples using the pre-programmed options in the Date category.

Also assume that the cost per cubic inch for the Praline torte is $0.10, for the Sacher torte $0.11, and for the Opera torte $0.12. Let's create a spreadsheet (see sheet Cakecost of file Excel_Formulas.xlsx) that computes the cost of producing each type of cake. The volume of a cake with radius r and height h is &#928;r<span style=\"vertical-align: super; font-size: 8px;\">2</span>h.  Here r = cake radius in inches and h = cake height in inches. Recall that radius = diameter/2.</p><p>We want to enter a formula in E15 to compute the cost of producing the Sacher torte. Then we hope to copy this formula down to the range E16:E17 and thereby compute the cost of producing the other cakes. Clearly our cost formula in cell E15 will need to depend on the diameter and height which are given in cells D10 and D11. The problem is that if we reference D10 and D11 in our formula in cell E15 and copy the formula down, then D10 will change in cell E16 to D11 and D11 will change in cell E16 to a D12 reference. We do not want this to happen! The solution is to enter cell D10 in our formula as $D$10 and enter cell D11 in our formula as $D$11. A $ sign before the row of a cell reference ensures that when we copy the formula the row reference remains unchanged. Similarly, a $ sign before the number in a cell reference ensures that when we copy the formula, the column reference remains unchanged. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"a4 asset\">\n\t<center>\n    <div id=\"kaltura_player_1391462708\" style=\"width: 704px; height: 265px;\" itemprop=\"video\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/VideoObject\">\n<span itemprop=\"name\" content=\"4338/0\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"description\" content=\"Absolute_Adressing\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"duration\" content=\"\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"thumbnail\" content=\"\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"width\" content=\"491\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"height\" content=\"315\"></span>\n</div>\n<script src=\"https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/506471/sp/50647100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/9952721/partner_id/506471?autoembed=true&entry_id=1_m0vscqe1&playerId=kaltura_player_1391462708&cache_st=1391462708&width=491&height=315&flashvars[streamerType]=auto\"></script>\n    </center>\n</div>\n"

An x in Column E indicates the person is a friend. Recall that in  an IF statement we first check the left-hand-most condition. Therefore, we must first check if the customer is a friend and has purchased enough to get a discount. If so, that customer's discount is 1.5 times the entry in column D (which we compute in column F). If customer is not a friend who has bought more than the number needed for the discount, then we  give a discount equal (in percentage terms) to the entry in column D.

The syntax =MATCH (lookup value, lookup range,0) works as follows. If the lookup range is in a single column, the MATCH function finds the first occurrence of the lookup value and returns how many rows down the lookup value is in the lookup range. If the lookup range is in a single row, then the MATCH function finds the first occurrence of the lookup column and returns how many columns across the lookup value is in the lookup range. The last argument of 0 is needed because usually our lookup range will not have sorted values. We will not discuss MATCH functions with last arguments of +1 or -1 since they are rarely used.  As an example of the use of the MATCH function, let's find the first occurrence of Pear Charlotte in the list of products in column F of worksheet <em>Match</em> <i>and</i> <em>index</em>.

The Excel functions ROUNDUP, ROUNDDOWN, ROUND and INT are useful in these situations. A description of the syntax of each function follows:</p><ul><li>ROUNDUP(number,n) rounds the number up <strong>(away from 0)</strong> using n significant digits. Using n = 0 results in the number being rounded up to the nearest integer. For example, ROUNDUP(3.2,0) returns 4 and ROUNDUP(PI(), 2) returns 3.15.</li><li>ROUNDDOWN(number, n) rounds the number down <strong>(toward 0)</strong> using n significant digits. Using n = 0 results in the number being rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, ROUNDDOWN(3.2,0) returns 3 while ROUNDOWN(PI(), 2) returns 3.14.</li>\n    <li>ROUND(number, n)  rounds the number to n significant digits. If there is a tie on which number to round to, Excel rounds to the highest number. For example, ROUND(3.5,0) yields  4. Also ROUND(3.4,0) returns 3 and ROUND(3.6,0) returns 4.</li><li>INT(number) rounds the number down  to the nearest integer. For example, INT(3.4) returns 3 and INT(-4.7) returns -5.</li><li>For positive numbers there is no difference  between the ROUNDDOWN and INT function. For example, INT(4.8) = ROUNDDOWN(4.8,0) = 4. For negative numbers, however, the ROUNDDOWN and INT functions may yield different results. For example, INT(-4.3) = -5 but ROUNDDOWN(-4.3,0) = -4.</li></ul>\n</div>\n",

Excel contains several functions that help us model uncertain events such as the daily demand for Sacher Tortes.  In this section, we will discuss two such functions: RAND() and RANDBETWEEN. In a future chapter, we will study in more detail how to use an Excel add-in, @RISK, to model uncertainty.

A na&#237;ve decision maker might say that Machine 1 is better because the total value of the revenues less costs is $1000, while for Machine 2 this sum is $760. This reasoning ignores the important concept of the time value of money. It is better to receive $1 now than in the future. Similarly, it is better to pay out $1 in the future than pay out $1 now. The proper way to evaluate projects which involve cash flows occurring at different times requires us to assign a <strong>discount rate</strong> (usually between 10% and 20% per year) that incorporates the time value of money. A discount rate of 10% means $1 received now is equivalent to receiving $1.10 a year from now. Dividing both sides of this relationship by 1.10 we find that $1/1.10 now is equivalent to $1 received one year from now. \n    Similar logic shows that $1 received 2 years from now is worth the same as receiving $1/1.1<span style=\"vertical-align: super; font-size: 8px;\">2</span> now and in general receiving $1 n years from now is the same as receiving 1/1.1<span style=\"vertical-align: super; font-size: 8px;\">n</span> dollars now, The <strong>Net Present Value (or NPV)</strong> of a sequence of cash flows simply converts all cash flows to today's dollars by multiplying cash flows received at time n by a factor 1/(1+discount rate)<span style=\"vertical-align: super; font-size: 8px;\">n</span> which  puts the cash flows into today's dollars.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"a4 asset\">\n\t<!--<div id=\"lfp-259\"/>-->\n    <img src=\"%PAGE_ROOT%/5396_1_pic1.png\" alt=\"Excel Financial Functions t2\" />\n</div>\n",

Here rate must be an annual discount rate.  Let's utilize the XNPV function to compute the NPV for Machine 1 and Machine 2. We will use the function wizard (indicated by the small f<span style=\"vertical-align: sub; font-size: 8px;\">x</span>  icon on your ribbon) to input our formula involving XNPV. The function wizard is a helpful aid that makes it easy to input the proper syntax for unfamiliar functions. You simply go the cell where you want to enter the formula and click on the Function Wizard icon. Then select the type of function (here we select Financial) and then move to the list of functions. Next, type in the first few letters (say XN for XNPV) of the function's name and you will move to the correct function. \n    Then follow the prompts and the proper formula will appear in your cell!

The idea of Internal Rate of Return (IRR) does not require a discount rate. The IRR of a sequence of cash flows is simply the discount rate that makes a project's NPV =0. For example if we discount a project's cash flows at 12% and get an NPV of 0, we can say this project, roughly speaking, is earning a 12% annual return on our investments. In rare cases, projects can have multiple IRR's or even no IRR, but we will leave discussion of that problem to your finance professors! To find the IRR of a sequence of cash flows, we will use the XIRR function (syntax XIRR(cash flows, dates, guess)). Guess is usually a \"guess\" at the project's IRR (we recommend using guesses in the range between -80% to +80%). Without a Guess near the project's actual IRR, Excel may return a #NUM error indicating that it cannot find an IRR. Therefore we recommend always trying guesses of say -.8, -.4, 0, .4 and .8. We will now use the XIRR function to find the IRR for the cash flows associated with Machines 1 and 2.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"a4 asset\">\n\t<center>\n  <div id=\"kaltura_player_1390596699\" style=\"width: 421px; height: 272px;\" itemprop=\"video\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/VideoObject\">\n<span itemprop=\"name\" content=\"5396/4\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"description\" content=\"Excel_Financial_Functions_t5\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"duration\" content=\"\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"thumbnail\" content=\"\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"width\" content=\"491\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"height\" content=\"315\"></span>\n</div>\n<script src=\"https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/506471/sp/50647100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/9952721/partner_id/506471?autoembed=true&entry_id=1_t2gpz8gw&playerId=kaltura_player_1390596699&cache_st=1390596699&width=491&height=315&flashvars[streamerType]=auto\"></script>\n\n  <!-- <div id=\"kaltura_player_1479520247\" style=\"width: 491px; height: 315px;\" itemprop=\"video\" itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/VideoObject\">\n<span itemprop=\"name\" content=\"5396/4\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"description\" content=\"Excel_Financial_Functions_t5\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"duration\" content=\"122\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"thumbnail\" content=\"https://cdnsecakmi.kaltura.com/p/506471/sp/50647100/thumbnail/entry_id/1_t2gpz8gw/version/100011/acv/181\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"width\" content=\"491\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"height\" content=\"315\"></span>\n</div>\n<script src=\"https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/506471/sp/50647100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/31539841/partner_id/506471?autoembed=true&entry_id=1_t2gpz8gw&playerId=kaltura_player_1479520247&cache_st=1479520247&width=491&height=315&flashvars[streamerType]=auto\"></script> -->\n   \n    </center> \n</div>\n<div class=\"a5 asset\">\n\t <p>The relationship between IRR and NPV is as follows:  NPV&gt;0 if and only if Project IRR&gt;discount rate.</p>\n</div>\n",

For example, suppose we want to determine how many transactions were completed by Charlene in the South. The COUNTIF function can only handle criteria involving one column. Our current problem involves criteria incorporating two columns: Sales person and Location. For such problems we can use the COUNTIFS function. The S at the end means that multiple or plural criteria are allowed. The syntax of the COUNTIFS function is COUNTIFS(Criteria range 1,criteria 1, Criteria range2, criteria2, ...Criteriarangen, criterian).  This counts the number of rows for which each criteria range meets the desired criteria. To illustrate the use of the COUNTIFS function, let's determine how many transactions Charlene completed in the South.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"a4 asset\">\n    <center>\n\t <div id=\"kaltura_player_1387566573\" style=\"width: 549px; height: 344px;\" itemprop=\"video\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/VideoObject\">\n<span itemprop=\"name\" content=\"5408/3\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"description\" content=\"Conditional_Counts_t4\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"duration\" content=\"\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"thumbnail\" content=\"\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"width\" content=\"491\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"height\" content=\"315\"></span>\n</div>\n<script src=\"https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/506471/sp/50647100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/9952721/partner_id/506471?autoembed=true&entry_id=1_iuqnnguc&playerId=kaltura_player_1387566573&cache_st=1387566573&width=491&height=315&flashvars[streamerType]=auto\"></script> \n\n<!-- <div id=\"kaltura_player_1479521394\" style=\"width: 491px; height: 315px;\" itemprop=\"video\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/VideoObject\">\n<span itemprop=\"name\" content=\"5408/3\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"description\" content=\"Conditional_Counts_t4\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"duration\" content=\"63\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"thumbnail\" content=\"https://cdnsecakmi.kaltura.com/p/506471/sp/50647100/thumbnail/entry_id/1_iuqnnguc/version/100041/acv/211\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"width\" content=\"491\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"height\" content=\"315\"></span>\n</div>\n<script src=\"http://cdnapi.kaltura.com/p/506471/sp/50647100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/31539841/partner_id/506471?autoembed=true&entry_id=1_iuqnnguc&playerId=kaltura_player_1479521394&cache_st=1479521394&width=491&height=315&flashvars[streamerType]=auto\"></script> -->\n</center>\n</div>\n",

This worksheet contains the sales of Flans, Tarts, &#233;clairs and Napoleons by region. We would like to highlight in yellow for each product the region with the largest sales. To do this we need to select the cell range E12:H15, and after selecting the Formula option from conditional formatting, enter a formula that will test whether E12 is the largest number in its column. We could enter =E12=MAX(E12:E15). This formula will be true if and only if E12 contains the largest sales for Flans. Note, however, if we copy this formula down to cell E13 the formula becomes = E13=max(E13:E16). Of course, we want this formula to be =E13=max(E12:E15) so <strong>we need to $ sign the 12 and 15 in our original formula. We do not dollar sign the E because when we copy across to say F12 we want the formula to be =F12=max(F12:F15).</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"a4 asset\">\n\t <div id=\"kaltura_player_1390597487\" style=\"width: 491px; height: 312px;\" itemprop=\"video\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/VideoObject\">\n<span itemprop=\"name\" content=\"5445/3\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"description\" content=\"Comparison_using_function\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"duration\" content=\"\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"thumbnail\" content=\"\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"width\" content=\"491\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"height\" content=\"315\"></span>\n</div>\n<script src=\"https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/506471/sp/50647100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/9952721/partner_id/506471?autoembed=true&entry_id=1_0uzae0ht&playerId=kaltura_player_1390597487&cache_st=1390597487&width=491&height=315&flashvars[streamerType]=auto\"></script> \n\n<!-- <div id=\"kaltura_player_1479694037\" style=\"width: 491px; height: 315px;\" itemprop=\"video\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/VideoObject\">\n<span itemprop=\"name\" content=\"5445/3\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"description\" content=\"Comparison_using_function\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"duration\" content=\"54\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"thumbnail\" content=\"https://cdnsecakmi.kaltura.com/p/506471/sp/50647100/thumbnail/entry_id/1_0uzae0ht/version/100021\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"width\" content=\"491\"></span>\n<span itemprop=\"height\" content=\"315\"></span>\n</div>\n<script src=\"http://cdnapi.kaltura.com/p/506471/sp/50647100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/31539841/partner_id/506471?autoembed=true&entry_id=1_0uzae0ht&playerId=kaltura_player_1479694037&cache_st=1479694037&width=491&height=315&flashvars[streamerType]=auto\"></script> -->\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"a5 asset\">\n    <img src=\"%PAGE_ROOT%/Comparison_using_function.png\">    \n</div>",

In a multiple worksheet model, inputs should be placed in a single worksheet. Decision variables can be placed near inputs or given their own worksheet, if possible. In a single worksheet model inputs and decision variables should be placed in a single area.

Basically, this means that if our input assumptions are correct, then the bakery should be built. For our key inputs we can ask the following question: how much would a key input have to change in value in order for our final decision to change? For example, we may currently be assuming annual sales growth of 15%. For this value, our model says go ahead with the bakery. We might ask how bad an annual growth rate could be before opening the bakery would be a poor decision. If we found, for example, that if annual growth is -30% or better we should still build the bakery, we would feel pretty good about going ahead with the bakery. Using Excel's Goal Seek feature, we can easily determine the value of each input that would make the project NPV = 0.  This helps us determine how sensitive our final decision is to changes in each input.</p>\n</div>\n",

The considerate modeler has an obligation to set up the model so users will be informed when they have made an input error. For example, suppose we model Revenue and Units sold as model inputs and we need to calculate price with the formula =revenue/units_sold. If Units_sold = 0 we will receive an error message.(#DIV/0.) As explained in the \"Useful Excel Functions\" chapter, we can use IFERROR (or often an IF statement) to inform the model user of his or her input error. For example, computing price with the formula =IFERROR(Revenue/Units_Sold,\"Units sold must be >0\") would inform the user of an error if the user enters a value of units sold&lt;=0. Excel's Data Validation feature (to be covered later in this chapter) can also be used to reduce the frequency of input errors.</p><p>You may also use the Error Checking option to check a worksheet for errors. Simply select the entire worksheet by choosing the Select All button (between the Column A and Row 1 Label) and then choosing Error Checking from the Formula Tab. Excel will then point out all errors it finds in the worksheet. Often, however, Excel flags formulas that are OK.</p>\n</div>\n",

For example, if a model requires sales revenues for products sold by a company, then we should set up the model so products can be added or subtracted from the list of products. In our bakery model we do not know the number of years for which the bakery will operate, so we should set up the model to easily enable us to vary the number of years of operation.</p>\n    <p>Excel's Table Feature can often make it easy to incorporate flexibility into your model.

That is, there is a fixed cost of $400,000 incurred in building a bakery and a cost of $3 per unit of pastry capacity.

To simplify our model we will assume Le Napoleon assigns a Year 1 price and thereafter price grows by the same percentage (5%) each year. Initially we will assume a Year 1 price of $3.00. For simplicity, we will assume each year's demand is a linear demand curve of the form Year 1 demand = a - bp. This is probably unrealistic because if price is sufficiently large this equation predicts negative demand. Despite this fact, many analysts utilize a linear demand curve. Many analysts assume demand = ap<span style=\"vertical-align: super; font-size: 10px;\">-b</span>. This is called the power or constant elasticity demand curve.</p>\n    <p>How can we determine a and b for our demand curve? The parameter a is simply the estimated annual demand if we chose a price of $0. Let's suppose 420,000 pastries. The parameter b is our estimated loss in annual demand if we increase the price by $1. We will assume b = 60,000. Placing the values of a and b in cells rather than directly in formulas will make it easy to change the values of a and b and determine how this impacts the bakery's projected viability.</p>\n    <p>For demand after year 1 we will use a two-stage growth model.

Of course, our inputs and decision variable estimates may not be correct or be subject to change. We would like to examine how sensitive our model output (NPV) is to changes in our decision variables and/or inputs.  Data tables are probably the tool most widely used to perform sensitivity analysis in Excel. A <strong>one-way data table</strong> allows us to determine how a change in a single input or decision variable changes one or more spreadsheet outputs or calculations. We will use a one-way data table to determine how a change in price affects bakery NPV. For simplicity we will assume that all Le Napoleon's bakeries have a capacity of 300,000 pastries per year. To create a one-way data table, we begin by listing, in a column, possible values for our input or decision variable (in this case, price). Then we enter the formulas for the outputs of interest going across a row (starting one row above first input value and one column to the right of the listed input values). After selecting Data Table from the What-If portion of the data tab, we can make our Data Table compute the value of each listed formula for each listed input value. Then we can see how sensitive our formulas (usually model outputs) are to changes in a decision variable or model input.</p>\n</div>\n",

We have now established that if we build a 300,000 pastry annual capacity and charge $4.50 during 2013, the bakery will add over $2 million in value to Le Napoleon. Of course, this result assumes that our assumptions about values for other inputs are accurate. Before building the bakery it would be a good idea to determine how much our other model inputs must change to make building the bakery a bad idea (NPV&lt;0). Excel's Goal Seek feature is perfectly suited to this task. Essentially, Goal Seek allows us to find the value of a cell that makes a particular formula hit a desired value. For example, we will use Goal Seek to determine the annual growth rate in demand that would cause the bakery NPV drop to 0.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"a4 asset\">\n\t<!--<div id=\"lfp-367\"/>-->\n    <img src=\"%PAGE_ROOT%/5505_0_pic1.png\" alt=\"Using Goal To Seek Image\" />\n</div>\n",

Let's suppose that our beginning growth rate in demand (which is entered in cell D9) should be allowed to vary between 0% and 50% in 1% increments. What makes this tricky is that the minimum increment on a spinner is 1, not .01. To work around this problem, we link the spinner to cell F9 <strong>and in cell D9 enter the formula =F9/100</strong>. Now we can set the spinner in E9 so that cell F9 varies from 0-50 in increments of one.

Here are some limitations of our model:</p><ul><li>We have assumed a linear demand curve. Often the relation between price and demand is not linear.</li><li>The two-stage growth model may not be accurate. To test the validity of the two-stage growth model we could check whether the demand growth for past bakery openings has followed the two-stage growth model.</li>\n    <li>Our model for building cost as a function of capacity may not be accurate. Modelers often assume that building a plant with capacity x incurs a cost of a+ bx<span style=\"vertical-align: super; font-size: 8px;\">k</span>, where 0&lt;k&lt;1. This type of model ensures that the cost of adding additional units of capacity decreases as more units are added.</li><li>Finally, none of our parameters are known with certainty. If we are highly uncertain about our model inputs, we should use Monte Carlo Simulation to model the probability distribution of each input and generate a range of possible NPV's.

If the objective cell and constraints of your Solver model are created by adding together terms of this form, the Simplex LP Method should be checked from the Select A Solving Method drop-down box. This enables the Solver to use an efficient method (the simplex algorithm) to solve your problem. Solver is guaranteed to find an optimal solution to any linear model containing at most 200 variable cells and 200 constraints. Versions of Solver that can solve larger problems can be purchased from Solver.com. Solver has a much harder time finding an optimal solution to a nonlinear model. For a discussion of nonlinear solver models we refer the reader to Practical Management Science, 4<span style=\"vertical-align: super; font-size: 8px;\">th</span> edition.</p>\n    <p>Our Solver model is linear. For example, the objective cell is calculated by adding together terms of the form (units of product made)*(unit profit for a product). Thus the objective cell is created by adding together terms of the form specified by the bullet above. Therefore we check the Assume Linear Model option. By the way, if you try to solve a linear Solver model and do not check the Assume Linear model box, the Solver may have a difficult time finding the optimal solution.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"a5 asset\">\n  <img src=\"%PAGE_ROOT%/assume_linear.png\" style=\"padding:0px; margin:0px;\" />\n</div>\n",

Most of the time when we start developing a spreadsheet, we enter data with each row representing data. For example, we might enter sales of each product in a different row. Then we usually add new data to the bottom of the spreadsheet and perhaps add formulas to the right of our data to analyze the data. Usually we have to scramble and manually change our formulas or graphs to include the new data. We may also choose to extend the formatting used for the original data to the new data.</p>\n  <p>Excel's  Table feature makes it a snap to add new rows of data or formulas to a spreadsheet. \n    The Table feature ensures that, when we add new data or new formulas, our old formulas and graphs will automatically update to include the new data. Our old formatting will also be automatically extended to our new data.</strong></p><p>At any time you can select a range of cells, and by hitting Control + T you will make that range of cells a table.</p>\n</div>\n",

We model a continuous random variable by defining a <strong>probability density function (pdf) </strong> for the random variable. A pdf is simply a non-negative function whose value for a given number describes the relative likelihood of the random variable assuming a value near x. The area under a pdf between x and y is the probability that the random variable assumes a value between x and y. <strong>The total area under a pdf must equal 1.</strong> In our development we will use two simple continuous random variables: the Uniform and Triangular random variable.</p>\n</div>\n",

For example, if the daily demand for Napoleons is equally likely to be anywhere between 50 and 200 Napoleons, then our density for the demand for Napoleons would look as follows:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"a4 asset\">\n\t<!--<div id=\"lfp-318\"/>-->\n    <img src=\"%PAGE_ROOT%/5494_5_pic1.png\" alt=\"Continuous Random Variables: The Uniform Distribution\" />\n</div>\n<div class=\"a5 asset\">\n\t<p>Note the density is uniform or constant everywhere on the interval [50, 200]. The height of the density at each value between 50 and 200 is 1/150 = 0.00666. This makes the total area under the density function equal to 1. We see, for example, the probability that demand is between 80 and 170 is 60%. We can model a U[a, b] random variable with the @risk function RISKUNIFORM(50,200). Entering this function in a cell ensures that any value between 50 and 200 is equally likely to be entered in the cell.</p>\n</div>\n",

Due to its simplicity, the triangular random variable is by far the most used random variable in Monte Carlo modeling. To illustrate the use of the triangular random variable, let's suppose we want to model the market size for a new pastry. All we do is estimate the lowest possible market size (say 40,000 units per year), the most likely market size (say 60,000 units per year), and estimate the largest possible market size (say 70,000). Then we create a PDF for market size simply by constructing a triangle starting at the lowest market size of 40,000. The height of the density increases along a straight line until we hit the most likely value of 60,000 units. Now we make the triangle slope down until it hits the x-axis at 70,000 units. \n    The maximum height of the triangle is scaled so the total area under the PDF is 1. (See graphic.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"a4 asset\">\n\t<!--<div id=\"lfp-320\"/>-->\n    <img src=\"%PAGE_ROOT%/5494_6_pic1.png\" alt=\"The Triangular Distribution Graph\" />\n</div>\n<div class=\"a5 asset\">\n\t<p>Note that our triangular PDF implies, for example, that there is an 87.5% chance that market size is between 45,000 and 65,000.  Also a market size near 60,000 is twice as likely as a market size near 50,000 (because the density is twice as large at 60,000 as 40,000). We can model this random variable using @RISK by entering the function RISKTRIANG(40000,60000,70000) in a cell. In such a cell, for example, a market size near 60,000 would be twice as likely as a market size near 40,000.</p>\n    <p>The triangular random variable has become popular because it generalizes the common practice of analyzing a business case by creating a best case, worst case, and most likely scenario. The triangular random variable simply allows for the possibility that <strong>any</strong> value between the best and worst case has a chance of happening. Now let's show how to use Monte Carlo simulation and the @RISK add-in to help Le Napoleon decide whether it should introduce a new product.</p>\n</div>\n",

Any leftover drugs spoil and are worthless. \n    A cost of $10 per unit (due to customer dissatisfaction) is assessed if we cannot meet demand. What is the expected annual profit for this drug?
